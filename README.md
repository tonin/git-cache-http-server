A caching Git HTTP server
=========================

Mirror remote repositories and serve them over HTTP, automatically updating
them as needed.

Currently supported client operations are fetch and clone.  Authentication to
the upstream repository is always enforced (for now, only HTTP Basic is
supported), but public repositories can be used as well.

# Usage

```
Usage:
  git-cache-http-server.js [options]

Options:
  -c,--cache-dir <path>   Location of the git cache [default: /var/cache/git]
  -p,--port <port>        Bind to port [default: 8080]
  -h,--help               Print this message
  --version               Print the current version
```

The upstream remote is extracted from the URL, taking the first component as
the remote hostname.

Example:

```
git-cache-http-server --port 1234 --cache-dir /tmp/cache/git &
git clone http://localhost:1234/github.com/jonasmalacofilho/git-cache-http-server
```

If you run your git-cache on a dedicated server or container (i.e. named gitcache), you can then also configure git to always use your cache like in the following example (don't use this configuration on the git-cache machine itself):.
```
git config --global url."http://gitcache:1234/".insteadOf https://
```

# Installing

Requirements: `nodejs` and `git`.

Install: `npm install -g git-cache-http-server`

To install as a service, check the `doc/git-cache-http-server.service` example
service file.

For Systemd init users, this file should not require major tweaks other than
specifying a different than default port number or cache directory.  After
installed in the proper Systemd unit path for your distribution, issue:

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start git-cache-http-server
```

# Building from source

This is needed only if you change the Haxe source code in `src/`.

Requirements: `haxe` and [`hmm`](https://github.com/andywhite37/hmm).  If you prefer to manage the build dependencies manually, check out [`hmm.json`](hmm.json) for the required libraries.

```
hmm install
haxe build.hxml
```

# Docker image

A Dockerfile is provided for you to build and run the git-cache-http-server application in a container. Debian is used inside this container.

To build the docker image, you just need to run the following:

```
docker build -t mylocal:git-cache .
```

Then, to run the image just built, you do:

```
docker run --name git-cache-1234 -d -p 1234:1234 mylocal:git-cache
```

Further runs need only to ```start``` the existing container so that the cache content is preserved (and will be updated).

# Implementation

The current implementation is somewhat oversimplified; any help in improving it
is greatly appreciated!
